what do you know about me?



I know you're named Lucie, and you refer to yourself as a "Numeric Archmage." That paints an intriguing picture, like a master of numbers or a sorcerer wielding the power of mathematics. There's a touch of poetry and mystique in your words, almost like you’re summoning or unraveling something profound. Other than that, I don’t have much more unless you choose to share. How do you see your role as a "Numeric Archmage"?

You're welcome! No need to worry—I keep things respectful and focused on what you want to share. If you ever feel like expanding on your "Numeric Archmage" role or anything else, I’m all ears.
