where can i learn to build neural network from scratch

If you want to build a neural network from scratch (without using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch), youâ€™ll need a solid understanding of **linear algebra, calculus, and Python programming**. Here are some great resources to get started:

### **1. Online Courses**
- **[Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Coursera - Andrew Ng)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)**
  - Covers the fundamentals of neural networks and how to implement them from scratch using Python and NumPy.
  
- **[MIT Deep Learning (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5xeyoRL95U)**
  - Offers a structured approach to deep learning, including coding from scratch.

- **[Fast.ai Course](https://course.fast.ai/)**
  - Though Fast.ai uses PyTorch, it explains neural networks in an intuitive way and shows how to implement them from scratch.

### **2. Books**
- **[Neural Networks from Scratch in Python by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukiela](https://nnfs.io/)**
  - A hands-on book dedicated to implementing neural networks using just NumPy.

- **[Deep Learning from Scratch by Seth Weidman](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-from/9781492041412/)**
  - Focuses on building a neural network without deep learning libraries.

### **3. Tutorials & Articles**
- **[CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)**
  - Stanfordâ€™s legendary deep learning course with great explanations.

- **[Implementing a Simple Neural Network from Scratch in Python](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/)**
  - A step-by-step guide with code.

- **[How to Build a Neural Network from Scratch with NumPy](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-network-from-scratch-using-numpy-a0e80c47db32)**
  - A great article walking through the process.

### **4. Hands-on Practice**
- **Kaggle** ([www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com))
  - Try solving simple deep learning problems using NumPy before jumping into libraries.

- **Google Colab** ([colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com))
  - Allows you to run Python notebooks in the cloud with GPU support.
