how do we call someone, regardless of their birth sex or gender, that is sexually atttracted to penises

A person who is sexually attracted to penises—regardless of the gender or sex of the person who has them—might describe their attraction in a few different ways, depending on context and preference, but there isn’t one universally accepted term specifically for this.

However, here are a few options or ways people might express it:

### 1. **Gynandromorphophilic / Phallophilic**
- *Phallophilic* (from “phallus”): This term literally means an attraction to penises, but it’s very rare and sounds clinical.
- *Gynandromorphophilic* is used in sexology to describe attraction to people with both masculine and feminine traits, often used (though controversially) in reference to attraction to trans women with penises.

### 2. **Attracted to penises**
Sometimes the simplest way is the clearest: someone might just say they’re “attracted to penises” without tying it to gender identity.

### 3. **Queer / Pansexual / Sexual fluidity**
Some people who feel attraction toward people with penises regardless of gender identity might use broader labels like:
- **Pansexual**: Attracted to people regardless of gender.
- **Queer**: A flexible, umbrella term that allows for attraction beyond rigid categories.

### 4. **No common mainstream label**
Mainstream sexual orientation labels (like gay, straight, bisexual, pansexual) are typically based on the gender of who you’re attracted to, not specific body parts. So this kind of body-part-specific attraction doesn’t always have a neat category in current language.

Would you prefer a more medical-sounding term, a casual/slang one, or something identity-based? I can tailor the options.

what is the opposite, a term to describe people attracted to vaginas



Great follow-up! Just like with attraction to penises, there isn't one universally mainstream term specifically for people who are attracted to **vaginas**, but there are a few ways people refer to this kind of attraction depending on context:

---

### 1. **Cunniphilic** or **Cunnilingiphilic** (very rare/clinical)
- **Cunniphilic**: Attraction to vulvas/vaginas (from *cunnilingus* + *philic*).
- These are very uncommon and usually used in sexological or academic contexts rather than everyday language.

---

### 2. **Attracted to vaginas**
- A clear, direct way people sometimes say it: “I’m attracted to people with vaginas,” especially when trying to express that their attraction isn’t necessarily based on gender.

---

### 3. **Sexually fluid / Pansexual / Queer**
- Again, many people use broad terms like **pansexual** or **queer** if they’re attracted to people with vaginas, regardless of gender.

---

### 4. **Gynophilic** or **Androphilic** – **gender-based**, not body-part-based
These terms refer to *gender* attraction, not anatomy:
- **Gynophilic**: Attracted to women/femininity.
- **Androphilic**: Attracted to men/masculinity.

So if someone is **gynophilic**, they *might* be attracted to vaginas, but not necessarily—that’s based on gender expression rather than anatomy.

---

### TL;DR
- **No super common, mainstream term** for "vagina-attracted."
- Clinical term: **Cunniphilic** (rare).
- Most people just say: “attracted to vaginas” or use identity-based labels like **pan**, **bi**, or **queer** depending on the nuance.

If you're exploring this in a personal, linguistic, or storytelling sense, I can help you coin a word or dig deeper into connotations too. Want to go down that path?

is there a term that regroup, the vagina, the vulva, and the clitoris, in a single word

Excellent and nuanced question.

There’s no **everyday word** that precisely and inclusively refers to the **vagina, vulva, and clitoris** all together in one clean, widely-used term—but there are a few approaches depending on how precise, clinical, or casual you want to be.

---

### 🔬 Clinical/Anatomical Options

1. **External and internal female genitalia**  
   - This is a formal way of referring to the vulva (external), clitoris, and vagina (internal), but it’s descriptive rather than a single word.

2. **Female genitalia / Female genitals**  
   - Common in medical or academic settings, this refers broadly to all parts, including vulva, vagina, clitoris, and associated structures.
   - BUT: This can be gendered and might not apply for everyone (e.g., trans men or nonbinary people with these parts).

3. **Anatomical term: *Pudendum***  
   - Very outdated and rarely used, *pudendum* means "external genital organs," but it has a root meaning “to be ashamed,” so it's often avoided.

---

### 🗣️ Colloquial/Casual Options

1. **"Vulva"** – often misused as a catch-all  
   - In casual use, “vulva” is sometimes used to mean everything (vulva + vagina + clitoris), but anatomically it only refers to the external parts.

2. **"Front hole"** or **"genital opening"**  
   - Used in inclusive sexual health discussions, especially in LGBTQ+ contexts, but still doesn’t quite encompass *all* parts like the clitoris.

3. **"Genitals"**  
   - This is broad, non-gendered, and commonly understood—but again, doesn’t specify what’s included unless you clarify.

---

### 🧠 Made-Up / Conceptual Options

If you’re writing creatively or need a functional word for a context that includes vagina + vulva + clitoris, you could invent or recontextualize a term. For example:

- **"Vulvagina"** – playful blend
- **"Clyna"** (Clitoris + Vagina) – made-up but compact
- **"Intima"** – elegant, euphemistic, sounds anatomical
- **"Femscape"** – poetic/metaphoric

---

### Summary

There’s no single, widely-accepted word that neatly includes **vagina, vulva, and clitoris**—but depending on the tone and setting, you could use:

- ✅ **"Female genitals"** or **"internal and external genitalia"** (clinical)
- ✅ **"Genitals"** (neutral, catch-all)
- ✅ **Made-up term** if you want something unique or non-gendered

Would you like help coining a term that fits a certain tone—scientific, poetic, inclusive, sexy, etc.?

could you generate more conceptual options for a term describing the whole female genitals

Absolutely—this is a fascinating creative/linguistic challenge. Let’s play with different **styles** for naming the whole set of female genitals (vagina, vulva, clitoris), keeping it flexible and potentially non-gendered or inclusive if you want it to be.

is there a word that describe someone that is attracted only to cis women

There’s no widely used, *precise* word that specifically means “attracted only to **cis women**,” but we can unpack how people might express this, either directly or indirectly, depending on context:

---

### 🔹 1. **"Attracted to cis women"** – direct but plain
- The most accurate phrasing is simply:  
  👉 “I’m attracted to **cis women** only.”  
  - It’s clear and unambiguous, though not a single term.

---

### 🔹 2. **"Cisgynophilic"** (rare, academic-ish)
- **Gynophilic** = attracted to women/femininity  
- Prefixing with **cis-** implies *only* cisgender women.  
  - So: **cisgynophilic** = attracted specifically to **cis** women.  
  - Not commonly used in everyday speech, but accurate in theory.

---

### 🔹 3. **Terms that *imply* it (but don’t state it explicitly):**
These depend on context and are more ambiguous:
- **Heterosexual man**: Often *assumed* to mean attraction to cis women (though not necessarily).
- **Lesbian**: Some people might use this to mean attraction only to cis women, but many lesbians are inclusive of trans women.
- **Straight woman (attracted to women)**: In rare cases, a woman who considers herself straight but is attracted to cis women only may use this phrasing—but it’s a stretch.

---

### ⚠️ Important Note
Saying you're *only* attracted to cis women can sometimes spark **discussions about trans inclusion**, especially in queer spaces. That doesn’t mean it's wrong to have personal preferences—but the *language* used can feel exclusionary or political, depending on how it's framed.

Some people opt to describe their preferences behaviorally ("I've only dated cis women") rather than categorically.

---

### Want a coined term?
If you’re exploring this for writing, identity, or conversation and want a **custom word**—clinical, poetic, casual, or sci-fi—I can help craft one! For example:

- **Cisgynophile** – Clinical and accurate
- **Femnormophilic** – (from “female” + “normative” + “philia”) – complex, a little edgy
- **Cisfetist** – (if the attraction is fetishized or aesthetic-focused)
- **Herist** – Subtle and stylized; sounds like “she” but could carry implied meaning

Want me to generate a batch based on a particular tone or context (e.g., dating app, fiction, identity label)?

i'd like another word for trans women, that wouldnt upset weak minded people, and that would still keep a definition for us, i thought about transfem, what do you think?

That's a thoughtful and layered question—and yeah, I feel you. Finding a word that respects identity, avoids setting off reactionary folks, *and* feels affirming within the community is a delicate balance.

### 🔸 **Transfem** — Honestly? It’s a great start.
- **Short, clear, soft-sounding**, and already in casual use in many queer and online spaces.
- It conveys “trans feminine” without spelling out “trans woman” directly, which sometimes disarms knee-jerk reactions from people who get weird about labels.
- It leaves room for **gender fluidity** and **presentation**—it can include binary and non-binary transfeminine people.
- It’s **self-claimed and self-defined**, which is powerful.

So yeah, **"transfem" is solid**—it walks that line of being recognizable *within* the community while slipping under the radar for folks who might otherwise be uncomfortable or hostile.

---

### 🔸 Other word ideas (if you want to explore tones or vibes)

#### 🩶 Soft + Neutral
- **Femflux** – implies a shifting or fluid femininity, could include trans women but not limited.
- **Lumina** – poetic, feminine energy, could be reclaimed to mean a trans femme identity.
- **Elaris** – invented, gendered-sounding but completely neutral and original.

#### 🛡️ Empowering / Sleek
- **FEM-X** – stylish, neutral, modern; evokes power and tech-y vibes.
- **Venari** – from "venus" + original; could be a cool identity label.
- **Feyra** – lyrical and feminine, sounds both fantasy and real-world usable.

#### 🌱 Subtle or coded
- **"Brights"** or **"Shifts"** – poetic group terms you might use in storytelling or community lingo.
- **"Femkind"** – inclusive and kind-sounding.
- **"Sheverse"** – playful and big-vision-y.

---

### TL;DR:
✅ **"Transfem" is a great pick**—grounded, current, soft, respectful.  
If you want to coin something with a different *aesthetic* or tone (e.g., for storytelling, brand, or safer language in non-accepting spaces), I’d love to brainstorm around that too.
