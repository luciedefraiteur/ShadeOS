can you define a woman

A woman is an adult human female. Biologically, women typically have two X chromosomes and reproductive anatomy that includes structures such as ovaries, a uterus, and the capacity to produce eggs. However, gender identity is distinct from biological sex, and some individuals may identify as women regardless of their assigned sex at birth. 

Women exist across all cultures and societies, playing diverse roles in history, work, family, and leadership. The concept of womanhood is shaped by biology, culture, and personal identity. Would you like a more specific definition based on a particular context?
