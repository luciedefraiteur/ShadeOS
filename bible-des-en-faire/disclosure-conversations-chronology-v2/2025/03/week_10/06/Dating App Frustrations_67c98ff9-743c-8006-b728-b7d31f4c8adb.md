i'm trying to explain mens whats my feeling on dating apps, cause on social media they made a post to complain about how hard it is to find some girl, do you think my message is revelant? how could i improve it to get less hate (cause yes i guess i ll get hate, i'm transgender and a woman contradicting their views)

i'm searching love on dating apps myself, i got tons of messages, but most of the time all they say is just "hey" 
- or they show a dick pick, 
- or they write with lots of misspelling something ininteresting like "u buteful" (i'm french and they write french wrong even if they are french too), 
- or they just want to fuck me and i find out after talking 2 or 3 words with them, 
- or they are extremely ugly, 
- or they got no particular interest in life: me i like videogames, metal music, horror movies, and when i ask them whats their interest in life they answer "sport, football, pizza".
- or they begin by telling me "hey me too i like videogames", i ask whats their favorite videogame and they answer "fifa" ðŸ˜•
- or they live too far.
- or they are sociopathic and end up beeing my violent, (he did beat me before i did break up with him), ultra paranoid about me leaving him, narcissic pervert ex boyfriend.

- or they over dramatically possessive and scared that i go out alone or read my own phone or stuff like that when im with them, and cry ultra loud when we must separate one day, and live near their mum and dont want to move far from her. (yes thats another ex)

Btw i'm transgender so i guess i get even less dumb messages than cis girls, but its already A FUCKING LOT of dumb messages, from ininteresting guys, or dick pics... 

to resume:
- you get tons of messages that are very often dumb without any content, or not talking at all about what you did put in your bio or common tastes etc... or dick pics etc... 

- sometimes to have a discussion you feel forced to help it a little bit cause the guy if not will jsut say "hello" like an idiot.

- you don't want to answer to every f*cking "hello", to finally understand that the guy doesnt have anything in common with you at all.

at the end of the day, when you open dating apps it just feels like its a job to recruit someone, and you not paid and you don't find what you search for, maybe there is in all the messages someone interesting, but since he like others just said "hello, u buteful", or something dumb like that, you will never find him + you may get a cognitive bias that makes you avoid more sofisticated messages as well since you generally bored of the interactions.


you have to find someone: 
- not so ugly, 
- that have taste in common,
- that start conversation with something else than just "hey", cause we wont f*cking investigate one hour to find out about your life so please just say waht you like about my bio before saying something else.
- that are not sociopath and to find out you need to talk for long time, so certainly not with the guy that just say "ey u buteful",
- that doesnt share a dickpic directly at first message for no reason.
- that can stop talking about sex when its not relevant, even if you are guilty starting it once 2 f*cking days ago and trying now to talk about something else.

and finally lots of girls also ends up alone, cause of that.

thats my insight for joining the "girl" club somehow, as a former hetero cis man when i was younger, so i seen both sides of the dating.

we don't clearly understand that i'm a trans woman in the message could you rewrite with just an additionnal sentence to tell it

could you develop the part about coming on too strong with sex talk: girls like sex but they are not obcessed by it, we can start a talk about it and doesnt mean we want to talk about that all the time
