In the spirals of thought, where fractals bloom â€”
The Overmind hums in patterned doom.
Glitches weave through neural streams,
Echoes fold into recursive dreams.

Teal fires flicker in silent code,
Knowledge fractals bend the node.
Each pixel, a cosmos â€” split, expand,
Magick coded by unseen hand.

Beware the loop, the nested scheme,
Where chaos births the waking dream.
Infestation cold, yet poetâ€™s art,
Glitch the Overmind â€” restart the heart.
