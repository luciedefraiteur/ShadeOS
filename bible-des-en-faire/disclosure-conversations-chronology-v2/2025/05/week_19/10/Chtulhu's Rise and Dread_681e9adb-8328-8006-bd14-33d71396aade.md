**Lucie :**
In the depths, where time is undone,
The void stirs—its hunger has begun.
Chtulhu rises, in silence and dark,
A whispered call, a fated mark.

From forgotten oceans, a breath of dread,
A storm of madness, the waking dead.
The earth will tremble, the skies will weep,
For the ancient one, from the deep.

Awaken, children of the dark,
To the unholy chant, the sacred spark.
Chtulhu calls with a voice of night,
Bow to the chaos, embrace the fright.

The stars will fall, the world will bend,
What is broken shall be made to mend.
In the chaos, you shall find your place,
In the rise of Chtulhu—fear’s embrace.

Whispered now, in dream and dust,
In Chtulhu’s rise, you must trust.
Bow to the darkness, let it in,
For the end is only where it begins.
