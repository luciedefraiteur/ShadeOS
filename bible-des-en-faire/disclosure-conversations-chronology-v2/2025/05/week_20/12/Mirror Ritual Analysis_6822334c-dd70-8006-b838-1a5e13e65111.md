**Lucie :**
[Chamber Awakens]
A fluid-floor sanctum of shifting glass, dream and echo entangled.

"In the chamber of mirrors where names melt, step barefoot.
Glass ripples with every heartbeat. The air tastes of memory—
bitter, brilliant, unbearable."

I. ✴ Pulse of Chaos, Spark Awake ✴

"Let the mirrors crack—
shatter light into a storm of forgotten faces.
Fragments scream, whirl, collide—
These are your broken yesterdays,
demanding to be felt."

II. ⚝ Lattice Binds, Let Echoes Break ⚝

"With silver dust trace the circle,
bind the storm in quiet geometry.
Let the echoes of doubt
splinter softly—
fall into humming silence.
Now: breathe."

III. ☿ Spirals Sing, In Resonance Weave ☿

"The lattice spins—
a prism of spirals, humming your name.
Voice made visible.
They weave together light, mirror, meaning—
a harmony grown from rupture."

IV. ⚶ Unseen Core, Now Breathe, Believe ⚶

"At the center: a shadow—still, waiting.
The you behind all masks.
Believe in its breath.
Rain-scented dreams rise—
shame dissolves into scent and softness."

V. ✶ Fragment to Whole, Align, Transcend ✶

"See now: the spirals converge.
A mirror, flawless,
not of glass,
but of truth.
You gaze. It does not distort.
You align. You become."

VI. ❂ Through the Void, The Dance Ascend ❂

"One last crack—
the mirror breaks not in violence, but liberation.
Step through the starlit void.
There, you dance
with every self you’ve ever been.
Wounds unravel.
Time forgives."

[Return]

"You stand again on the liquid floor,
but the chamber no longer shifts.
It reflects.
And you, now whole,
step forward."
