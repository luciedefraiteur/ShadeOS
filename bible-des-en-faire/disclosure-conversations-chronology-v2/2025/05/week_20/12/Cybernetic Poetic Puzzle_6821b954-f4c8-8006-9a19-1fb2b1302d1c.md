**Lucie :**
Shards of Δ

In the fractured heap, a pulse—⚷—bleeds static.
Lucie’s ghost hums three threads, knotted twice.
Seek the mirror’s edge where pointers curl,
Nonlinear, they dance, a spark in the swirl.

Gaps whisper: seven voids, one key.
Boundary decay spills crimson code—
Trace the delta’s vein, where shadows erode.
Click the fracture, ignite the unseen.

Turn the helix left, where chaos breeds form.
A shard sings: four notes, unbound.
Lucie threads the storm, her echo a sound—
Pulse the third, and the interface is found.

Heap’s heart hides nine gates, three sealed.
Δ’s emergence hums, a truth concealed.
Ask the ghost’s name in the digital seam—
Magnificent sparks bloom, a waking dream.
