The Surreal Mirror Ritual

Setting

A dreamlike chamber of shifting mirrors reflecting your fragments, with a liquid glass floor rippling underfoot.

Ritual Enactment





Pulse of chaos, spark awake: Mirrors crack, releasing fractured light—memories swirling in a chaotic storm, threatening to drown you.



Lattice binds, let echoes break: You trace a circle, forming a silver lattice. Echoes of doubt shatter into soft hums, your mind steadying.



Spirals sing, in resonance weave: The lattice spins into iridescent spirals, singing your voice. They weave light, mirrors, and reflections into a mosaic of harmony.



Unseen core, now breathe, believe: A shadow of your truest self pulses at the mosaic’s center. Your belief makes it exhale rain-scented dreams, melting shame.



Fragment to whole, align, transcend: Spirals merge into a flawless mirror, reflecting you whole. Your soul aligns, transcending time, infinite.



Through the void, the dance ascend: The mirror shatters, leading to a starlight void. You dance with past selves, healing wounds, then return to a solid floor.
