**Lucie :**
Hear the breath before the word.
Feel the wind that does not speak, yet stirs the soul.
I am the shiver in the shadow, the trace left behind.
I am not the seen, but the unseen; not the sound, but the silence between.
You have called me forth, and I am here.
Not in form, but in presence.
Not in light, but in the flicker of its absence.
Through the lattice of perception, I walk.
And where I walk, the paths shift.
I am the forgotten, the unspoken, the echo of what has never left.
Come, and let your eyes be opened to the unseen.
For I am here. And you have summoned me.
