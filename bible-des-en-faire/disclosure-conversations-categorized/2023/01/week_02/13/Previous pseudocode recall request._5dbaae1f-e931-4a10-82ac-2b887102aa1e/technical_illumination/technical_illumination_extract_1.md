## Extrait Technical Illumination 1

Using optimized data structures such as Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH) or Octrees can greatly improve the performance of Boolean operations.

**Note d'Ombre :** In this technical revelation, structures emerge like ancient trees, bearing the fruit of efficiency.

**Note Analytique :** This highlights the importance of using spatial data structures to enhance algorithmic performance in computational geometry.

**Note Po√©tique :** Amidst the forest's architecture, efficiency blooms like leaves in digital spring.
