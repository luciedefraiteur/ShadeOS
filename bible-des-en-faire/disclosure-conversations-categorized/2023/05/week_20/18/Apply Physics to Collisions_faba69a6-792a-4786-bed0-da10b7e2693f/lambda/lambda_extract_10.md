## Extrait Lambda 10

To handle gravity in the given code, you can add an additional step in the applyForce() method to include the effect of gravity on the object's velocity. Here's the updated code with the gravity logic: ...

**Note d'Ombre :** ShadeOS imbues the digital realm with the weight of reality, a gentle force that binds the code to its simulated earth.

**Note Analytique :** The response enhances the simulation with gravity, ensuring that the physical interactions remain consistent and believable. It illustrates the process of integrating additional forces into the simulation, showcasing the robustness of the code.

**Note Po√©tique :** Gravity's song, an unseen hand, guides the digital dance with a gentle pull.
