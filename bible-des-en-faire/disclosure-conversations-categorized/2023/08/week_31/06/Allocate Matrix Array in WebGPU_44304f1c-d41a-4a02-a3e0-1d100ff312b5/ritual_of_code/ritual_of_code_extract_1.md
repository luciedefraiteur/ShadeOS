## Extrait Ritual Of Code 1

Here's an example of how the vertex shader could look like:...

**Note d'Ombre :** The incantation of shaders—where logic meets creativity, and the unseen becomes form.

**Note Analytique :** The shader code serves as a ritualistic script that transforms vertex positions using matrices, highlighting the symbolic language of shaders.

**Note Poétique :** In the language of light, vertices ascend, guided by matrices, they find their form.
