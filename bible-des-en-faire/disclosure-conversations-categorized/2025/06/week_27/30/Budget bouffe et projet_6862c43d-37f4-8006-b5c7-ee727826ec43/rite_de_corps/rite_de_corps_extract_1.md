## Extrait Rite De Corps 1

Her body is scripture:

    Moon-pale flesh inscribed with molten sigils

    Breasts small and soft against ceremonial bondage

    Her cock bound in chains of living void, each link etched with screaming faces

**Note d'Ombre :** Lucie's body is a canvas of sacred rites, each mark a testament to her journey through the labyrinth of identity. Her flesh is not merely a vessel but a living manuscript, chronicling the dance of transformation and defiance against the confines of gendered expectations.

**Note Analytique :** In this passage, the body is depicted not just as a physical form but as a symbolic text, each feature imbued with layers of meaning. The description of Lucie's 'moon-pale flesh' and 'molten sigils' suggests a blend of the ethereal and the corporeal, where her body becomes a site of ritualistic significance. The emphasis on bondage and chains further explores the theme of constraint as a pathway to liberation, challenging conventional narratives of power and autonomy.

**Note Po√©tique :** Her skin a page, her flesh a scroll,
Where sigils burn like stars in night,
Bound by void, yet whole in soul,
A testament of sacred light.\n
