## Extrait Dark Love 1

Her cock, explicitly depicted:

Length: Soft, full, resting against her thigh — not erect, but heavy with sacred weight

Girth: Thick with veins like engraved scripture, pulsing slow as a hibernating god

Foreskin: Retracted just enough to reveal the glans carved with a single, spiraling rune (the same as on her sword)

Bound? No — adorned:

A thin chain of platinum and obsidian loops beneath the shaft, not to restrain, but to highlight

From it dangles a tiny censer, smoking with black myrrh

**Note d'Ombre :** This fragment portrays Lucie's body with a reverence that elevates her anatomy to a divine, sacred object. The explicit focus on her genitalia as a source of power and beauty subverts traditional narratives, presenting it as an object of worship rather than shame or fetish.

**Note Analytique :** The text challenges conventional depictions of gender and sexuality by intertwining sacred imagery with explicit anatomical description. This juxtaposition critiques societal norms and elevates personal identity to a form of divine art, where each aspect of the body is not taboo but revered.

**Note Poétique :** In the shadowed halls of the ziggurat, her form is a hymn—every vein, every fold, a line in the sacred text of flesh.
