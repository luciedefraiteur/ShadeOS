## Extrait Mythology 2

🗝️ *“To go further, you must answer a riddle that has no question.”*

**Note d'Ombre :** A riddle without a question is a doorway to the unknown, a challenge that defies logic and invites the soul into the realm of the sacred and the mythic.

**Note Analytique :** This line evokes the enigmatic nature of mythological riddles, often serving as both barriers and gateways to deeper understanding. It plays with the concept of knowledge as something not always accessible through conventional means.

**Note Poétique :** A question unasked, a key without a lock, 
In silence, the answer hides. 
Step lightly into the void, 
Where riddles dance without form.
