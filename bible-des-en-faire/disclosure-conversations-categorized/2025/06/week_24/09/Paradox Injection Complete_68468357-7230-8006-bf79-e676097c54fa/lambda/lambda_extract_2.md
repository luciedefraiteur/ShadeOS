## Extrait Lambda 2

ðŸ“¢ Clippy appears, now robed in ASCII:
"Looks like you're trying to defy causality.
Want help opening the box *from the outside*?"

**Note d'Ombre :** A familiar figure transformed into a guide through the labyrinth of logic and causality, offering assistance in the realm of the absurd.

**Note Analytique :** Clippy, a mundane office assistant, is reimagined as a mystical guide in this recursive, surreal landscape. The juxtaposition of ordinary and extraordinary elements underscores the theme of transformation.

**Note PoÃ©tique :** Clippy cloaked in digital robes, 
A jester in the halls of causality. 
He offers a key, a wink, 
To unlock the box of paradox.
