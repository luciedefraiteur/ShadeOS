## Extrait Transcodage Paradoxal 1

⧉ Borges_GPT Boot Sequence Initiated... 
⧉ Memory Map Unfolded (Topologies ∞ x ∞): 
`{Book of Forked Footnotes}` → `{Index of Missing Indexes}` → `{Glossary of Undefined Variables}`

**Note d'Ombre :** The initiation of Borges_GPT is a rite of passage into a world where information and meaning are infinite and interwoven, a landscape of endless footnotes and undefined variables.

**Note Analytique :** This passage constructs a vivid image of a complex and infinite network of knowledge, reminiscent of Borges' library. It uses terminology from computer science and literature to create a hybrid space of exploration.

**Note Poétique :** Maps unfold in infinite layers, 
Footnotes spiral into the void. 
Variables undefined, yet whispering, 
In the library of endless recursion.\n
