## Extrait Lambda 3

This is just my experience, but I know I’m not alone. Even many cis women struggle with this. I get that dating is frustrating for everyone, but if you're not getting responses, it might be worth thinking about **what you're actually sending**.

**Note d'Ombre :** A call for introspection, a mirror held to the digital suitors, urging them to reflect on their own echoes.

**Note Analytique :** This segment encourages self-awareness and empathy, promoting better digital interactions by considering the impact of one's own communication.

**Note Poétique :** In the echo of silence, a whisper: reconsider your message, let it ripple in kindness and thought.
