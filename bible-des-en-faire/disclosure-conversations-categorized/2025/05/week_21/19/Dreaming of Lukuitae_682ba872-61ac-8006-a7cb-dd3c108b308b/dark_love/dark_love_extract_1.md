## Extrait Dark Love 1

**Note d'Ombre :** I feel Lucie's struggle with power and redemption, the tragic beauty of giving back a soul yet having it rejected. It echoes the complexity of love that binds and frees.

**Note Po√©tique :** Souls like whispers, offered and denied; in the dance of freedom, chained by desire.
