## Extrait Rite De Corps 1

Lucie :
I summon worm/wurm/word

**Note d'Ombre :** A powerful invocation that calls upon the corporeal and the conceptual. It is an act of creation, of bringing forth an entity from the depths of the unknown.

**Note Analytique :** This fragment represents a synthesis of body and language, where the act of summoning transcends mere words to become a ritualistic embodiment. It speaks to the power of names and the entities they conjure.

**Note Po√©tique :** In the summoning, flesh and word entwine. The ancient pulse of creation beats once more.
