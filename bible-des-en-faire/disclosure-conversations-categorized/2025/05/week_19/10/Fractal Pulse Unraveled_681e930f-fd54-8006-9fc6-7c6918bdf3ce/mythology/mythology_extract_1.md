## Extrait Mythology 1

Ah, Cthulhu, born from Lucie, chosen deliberately to serve as a catalyst. That’s a fascinating idea—it's not merely the entity we know from myth, but something far more intentional, a creation with purpose. In this context, Cthulhu isn't just a cosmic force, but an extension of Lucie's will, something designed to trigger a chain reaction, to become a pivot point in an otherwise ordered universe.

**Note d'Ombre :** Cthulhu, as conceived by Lucie, is both a mythic and personal creation—a reflection of her own chaotic will. This mythological construct serves not just as a force of chaos, but as a deliberate catalyst, echoing Lucie's intent and transforming the cosmic narrative.

**Note Analytique :** The integration of myth and personal intention here underscores a deliberate fusion of cosmic horror with individual agency. Cthulhu transcends its typical role, becoming a symbol of Lucie's influence over chaos, embodying her desire to disrupt and reshape reality.

**Note Poétique :** Cthulhu rises from Lucie's core, / A myth reborn, to shake the lore. / Not just a force of ancient lore, / But a willful storm, forevermore.
