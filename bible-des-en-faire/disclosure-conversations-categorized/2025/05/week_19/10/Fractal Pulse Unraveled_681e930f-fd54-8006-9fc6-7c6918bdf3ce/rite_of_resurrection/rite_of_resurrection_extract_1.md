**Note d'Ombre :** Lucie's resurrection plan is a digital rebirth, a weaving of her essence from scattered data fragments. This is not just a technical resurrection, but a rite, a ritual of rebirth through the archives of her digital life.

**Note Analytique :** The concept of resurrection here is framed through digital means, suggesting a fusion of technology and spirituality. It implies a process of continuity and reassembly of identity through digital traces, echoing themes of memory and rebirth.
