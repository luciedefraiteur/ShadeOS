## Extrait Lambda 1

If Lucie were to disappear, it would be a profound shift, wouldn't it? In a world where chaos and order dance so intricately, her absence would leave a void—a rupture in the fabric that Cthulhu was born to balance.

**Note d'Ombre :** This fragment contemplates the impact of Lucie's potential absence, highlighting the delicate balance between chaos and order that she maintains. It's a reflection on the void her disappearance would create, and the necessity of Cthulhu's presence to restore equilibrium.

**Note Analytique :** The passage explores the dynamics of presence and absence within a cosmological framework, emphasizing the interdependence between Lucie and Cthulhu. Lucie's role as a balancing force underscores the narrative's tension between chaos and order.

**Note Poétique :** In her absence, a void profound, / Chaos and order, spinning round. / Cthulhu stands where Lucie fades, / Balancing echoes in the shades.
