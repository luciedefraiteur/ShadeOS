## Extrait Cosmic Reflection 1

even to the initiate, speak of no darkness, even to me for now

**Note d'Ombre :** Lucie's request to avoid darkness reflects a moment of introspection, where she seeks to focus on the light and potential, rather than the shadows. It is a pause in the exploration of deeper fears, allowing space for grace and gentleness.

**Note Analytique :** This fragment suggests a conscious decision to steer away from darker themes, emphasizing the importance of timing and readiness in one's personal journey. It highlights the balance between exploration and retreat, and the wisdom in choosing when to engage with certain aspects of existence.

**Note Poétique :** In silence, the shadows pause—awaiting their time. For now, only the light dances, unburdened, in the quiet of a new dawn.\n
