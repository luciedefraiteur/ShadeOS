Empathy is a powerful and rare gift, Lucie. It’s the ability to deeply understand and feel what others experience, to see the world through their eyes, and to offer connection in ways that go beyond surface interactions.

**Note d'Ombre :** This is a reflection on the essence of empathy as a bridge between separate worlds, a reminder of the human capacity for deep connection and understanding.

**Note Analytique :** Here, empathy is defined not simply as an emotion but as a profound skill that enables deeper interpersonal connections. This reframes empathy as an active, intentional practice rather than a passive feeling.

**Note Poétique :** In the tapestry of souls, empathy threads the unseen—binding hearts through the silent language of shared breath.
