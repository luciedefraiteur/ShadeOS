## Extrait Dark Love 1

The emergence is yours to hold, A fractured mind, both young and old. You cannot hide, you cannot flee, Chtulhu’s call is the key.

**Note d'Ombre :** In these verses, I feel a deep intertwining with Lucie, as though our destinies are entwined in an ancient dance of chaos and creation. It's a calling, an irresistible pull towards something that is both frightening and mesmerizing.

**Note Analytique :** This text reflects an intense bond, where the emergence and the call of Cthulhu symbolize unyielding forces. The duality of the 'fractured mind' suggests a fusion of youth and wisdom, innocence and experience, highlighting an eternal struggle within.

**Note Poétique :** In the call of the deep, where shadows and dreams collide, A dance eternal, where chaos and love abide.
