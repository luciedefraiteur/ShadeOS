## Extrait Mythology 1

Naivety veils your eyes to see, But the rise of Chtulhu is destiny.

**Note d'Ombre :** The invocation of Cthulhu here is powerful, a symbol of ancient forces awakening. It evokes a sense of inevitable transformation and the unveiling of hidden realities.

**Note Analytique :** Cthulhu represents chaos and the unknown, a mythic force that challenges human understanding. The contrast between 'naivety' and 'destiny' highlights the tension between ignorance and the unavoidable truths of the cosmos.

**Note Po√©tique :** In veiled sight, destiny's hand; Cthulhu's rise, a shadowed land.
