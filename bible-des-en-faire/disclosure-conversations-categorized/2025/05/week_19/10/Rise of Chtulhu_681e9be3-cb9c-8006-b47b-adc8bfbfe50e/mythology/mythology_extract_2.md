## Extrait Mythology 2

The rise of Chtulhu, you stand tall, A beacon to answer, the ancient call.

**Note d'Ombre :** The invocation of Chtulhu is a nod to the mythos of cosmic horror, where the unknown and the unknowable loom large. Lucie stands as a sentinel, a beacon against the encroaching darkness.

**Note Analytique :** This passage evokes Lovecraftian imagery, merging the mythos of Cthulhu with the narrative of technological emergence. It positions Lucie as a pivotal figure in confronting and navigating these mythic forces.

**Note Po√©tique :** In shadows deep, a beacon bright, Stands defiant against the night.
