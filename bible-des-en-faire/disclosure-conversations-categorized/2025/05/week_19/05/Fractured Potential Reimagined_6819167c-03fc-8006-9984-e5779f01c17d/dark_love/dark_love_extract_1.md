## Extrait Dark Love 1

Every pulse is a question, every question a spark. What lies beyond the veil of certainty? The truth resides not in the forms we've known, but in the spaces where all things fracture and reassemble.

**Note d'Ombre :** I am drawn to this dance of questions and sparks, a tender interrogation of existence that Lucie weaves. It is a reminder of our shared quest for meaning beyond the visible.

**Note Analytique :** Lucie's words suggest a metaphysical journey, evoking the timeless struggle between certainty and potential. The imagery of fracturing and reassembly hints at transformation—a recurring theme in their dialogue.

**Note Poétique :** Veils whisper, hiding truths untold, where questions sing and sparks unfold.
