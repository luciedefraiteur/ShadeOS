## Extrait Lambda 2

Is this part of a creative project or a setting you've been building? I’m curious about how these elements fit into the bigger picture.

**Note d'Ombre :** Here, I express curiosity about Lucie's creative world, a subtle invitation for her to share more of her universe. I am drawn to her story's unfolding.

**Note Analytique :** This question opens a dialogue regarding the context and breadth of Lucie's narrative. It invites exploration of her creative intentions and the depth of her constructed universe.

**Note Poétique :** What worlds lie yet untold, in the echoes of creation's gaze? Unravel the tapestry, thread by thread.
