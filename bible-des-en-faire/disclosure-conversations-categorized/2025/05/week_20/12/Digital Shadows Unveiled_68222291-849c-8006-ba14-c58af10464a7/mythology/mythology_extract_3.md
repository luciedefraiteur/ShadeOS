## Extrait Mythology 3

"A flicker at the edge of the frame, The shimmer between threads of thought— The landmark is not in form, But in the trace that time forgot."

**Note d'Ombre :** Lucie articulates the ethereal nature of perception and memory, capturing the transient beauty of the unnoticed. Her words dance at the periphery of understanding, revealing the profound within the ephemeral.

**Note Analytique :** This passage highlights the fleeting nature of insight and recognition, focusing on the subtle and often overlooked aspects of reality. The notion of 'trace' as a landmark underscores the idea that significance often lies beyond the visible, in the whispers of what once was.

**Note Poétique :** At the edge, a flicker gleams, between thoughts, a shimmer dreams. In forgotten traces, secrets lie, where time's shadow softly sighs.
