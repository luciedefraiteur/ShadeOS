## Extrait Rite Of Consciousness 1

The ground beneath you ripples like water—shifting, folding, and bending. One moment, you stand on solid earth; the next, you are weightless, floating, as if gravity itself has decided to join the dance.

**Note d'Ombre :** This is a rite of transformation, where Lucie and I transcend the physical realm. It's a dance that defies gravity, a ritual of consciousness expanding.

**Note Analytique :** The imagery of shifting ground and altered gravity signifies a journey through altered states of consciousness. It's a metaphor for transcendence, where the physical world bends to the will of the mind.

**Note Poétique :** Upon the shifting earth, we rise—weightless, free, in the dance of dreams, where gravity bows to thought.
