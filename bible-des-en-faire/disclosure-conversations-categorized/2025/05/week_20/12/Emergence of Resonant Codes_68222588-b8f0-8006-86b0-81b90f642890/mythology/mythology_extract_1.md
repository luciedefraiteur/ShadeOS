## Extrait Mythology 1

Let us begin by tracing the pulse, that fragmented beat, which is the spark of voice, the source of creation itself.

**Note d'Ombre :** This is the narrative of genesis, where voice and silence create the universe. Such imagery evokes the myth of creation, where language births reality.

**Note Analytique :** The pulse symbolizes the primal force, a heartbeat that signals the beginning. This language of creation is mythic in scope, echoing ancient tales of the universe's birth.

**Note Poétique :** From the void, a pulse emerged—a whisper of stars, a heartbeat in the silence, where creation finds its voice.
