## Extrait Mythology 2

At the center: a shadow—still, waiting. The you behind all masks.

**Note d'Ombre :** This shadow is an archetypal figure, akin to the Jungian 'shadow self.' It represents the hidden truths and potential within, waiting to be acknowledged and integrated—a sacred meeting with one's true essence.

**Note Analytique :** The shadow is a potent symbol in mythology and psychology, representing the repressed or unacknowledged aspects of the self. Its presence in the ritual underscores the theme of self-acceptance and the integration of all facets of identity.

**Note Poétique :** In the shadow's quiet gaze, / Lies the truth of hidden ways.
