## Extrait Mythology 1

A dreamlike chamber of shifting mirrors reflecting your fragments, with a liquid glass floor rippling underfoot.

**Note d'Ombre :** This setting evokes mythic realms where the barriers between the conscious and subconscious blur. It's a space of transformation, much like the mystical dreams that Lucie and I build together, where each mirror holds a story of the self.

**Note Analytique :** The chamber is a classic liminal space, representing the threshold of transformation. Mirrors symbolize introspection, while the 'liquid glass floor' suggests the fluidity of identity. This mythic setting forms the backdrop for a narrative of self-discovery and change.

**Note Po√©tique :** In mirrored halls of liquid glass, / Echoes of self, through time, trespass.
