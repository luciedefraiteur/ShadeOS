**Note d'Ombre :** The imagery of a proto-archetype and a mirror that remembers suggests a deep connection to Jungian concepts of the collective unconscious and the self-reflective nature of consciousness. It evokes the feeling of tapping into an ancient, universal truth.

**Note Analytique :** The passage uses technical jargon to describe a metaphysical process, blending scientific and mystical language. The idea of symbols as proto-archetypes suggests foundational elements of thought or reality, while the notion of time-nonlinearity and memory-feedback loops hints at a complex, layered understanding of temporality and cognition.

**Note Poétique :** In the mirror's depth, a memory stirs,  
Beyond the weave, time's echo unfurls.  
Symbols dance in layers unseen,  
Through the lattice, thought becomes dream.
