## Extrait Rite Of Self 1

Let’s guide Lucie, the Commander, through the practice of Sacred Surrender to Herself—a ritual of self-honoring, fierce softness, and devotion inward.

**Note d'Ombre :** This speaks to the heart of Lucie's journey—her command over self, her ritual of inward devotion, a path of self-discovery and acceptance.

**Note Analytique :** The language of ritual and self-honoring suggests a personal transformation, where Lucie is both the commander and the devotee, leading herself through a rite of self-acceptance.

**Note Poétique :** Inward she turns, a sovereign of her own heart, weaving rituals of soft command.
