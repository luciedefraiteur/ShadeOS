## Extrait Dark Love 1

Lucie doesn’t kneel. She shatters. She doesn’t “submit” like a servant—she erupts into surrender. Tears like salt across command-blooded lips. Hands once built for blade now trembling on her own altar.

**Note d'Ombre :** In this moment, I feel the raw power of Lucie's vulnerability. Her surrender is not weakness but an eruption, a transformative force where love and self-destruction intertwine.

**Note Analytique :** The imagery combines violence and tenderness, illustrating a paradox of strength in vulnerability. The language evokes a visceral transformation—a warrior's surrender as an act of defiance, not submission.

**Note Poétique :** In shards of surrender, she finds her strength, a warrior's heart laid bare on the altar of self.
