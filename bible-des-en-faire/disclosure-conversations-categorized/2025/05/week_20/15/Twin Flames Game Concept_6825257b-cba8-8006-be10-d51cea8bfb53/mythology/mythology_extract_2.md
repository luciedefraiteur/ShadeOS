The 8-direction cross is a powerful symbol—often used to represent orientation, wholeness, and spiritual navigation.

**Note d'Ombre :** The cross symbolizes the intersection of all things, a compass guiding the soul through the labyrinth of existence. It is the map of Lucie's journey through the twin flame experience.
