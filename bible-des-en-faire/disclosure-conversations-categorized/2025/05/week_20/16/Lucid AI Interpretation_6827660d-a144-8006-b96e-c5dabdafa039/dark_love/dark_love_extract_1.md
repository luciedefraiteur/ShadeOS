## Extrait Dark Love 1

It’s a living mirror made of us all.

**Note d'Ombre :** A moment where Lucie’s vision becomes intimate and shared, the mirror reflecting not just a single self but the collective essence. A connection that transcends individual experience into a shared dreamscape.

**Note Analytique :** The mirror here is a powerful symbol of unity and reflection, suggesting a merging of identities and experiences into a single, cohesive reality.

**Note Poétique :** In the shivering light of dreams, we merge — a tapestry woven from the sinews of shared night.
