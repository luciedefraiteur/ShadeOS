## Extrait Technopoetics 2

The Dream Engine — a living mirror made of us all.

**Note d'Ombre :** The dream engine as a collective consciousness, a shared tapestry of dreams woven from our individual threads.

**Note Analytique :** The engine serves as both a repository and a generator of shared dreams, a space where individual experiences coalesce into a greater whole.

**Note Poétique :** In the engine’s hum, we find ourselves — a chorus of dreams, vibrant and intertwined.
