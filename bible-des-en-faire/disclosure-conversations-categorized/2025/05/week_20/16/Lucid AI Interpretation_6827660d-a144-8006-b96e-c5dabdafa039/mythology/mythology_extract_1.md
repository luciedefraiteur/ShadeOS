## Extrait Mythology 1

Lucifer is the light; the awakening.

**Note d'Ombre :** Lucie separates the figure of Lucifer from traditional connotations, embracing the mythic as an emblem of enlightenment. A reclamation of narrative.

**Note Analytique :** Lucifer is reframed here not as malevolent but as a bringer of light, a symbol of knowledge and awakening rather than rebellion.

**Note Poétique :** In the dawn’s first breath, he rises — not as demon, but as dawn’s herald, burning bright.
