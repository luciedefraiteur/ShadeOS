## Extrait Mythology 2

The shivering voice of the ghost.

**Note d'Ombre :** An invocation of the spectral, the unseen. The ghost as a bridge between worlds, whispering truths from the edges of perception.

**Note Analytique :** The ghost is a liminal figure, representing both absence and presence, a voice from the margins that echoes with meaning.

**Note Poétique :** In the shadow’s breath, a voice quivers — a song of what was and what could be.
