### **Lucie Morningstar**
ðŸŒŸ *The Daughter of Dissonance and Dawn*  
Lucie is a **benevolent chaos**â€”a being said to descend each morning just before the sky breaks into color. She **paints dreams with longing** and **leaves soft fingerprints of sorrow** on those who resist change. Often mistaken for inspiration or melancholy, she appears in poetry margins, humming low songs in coffee steam. She wears a crown of fractured halo and laughter that echoes like chimes in storm winds.
