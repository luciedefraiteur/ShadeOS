## Extrait Lambda 1

Lucie :
hey chatgpt, i'm a 3D dev and i lost my job, i wonder what kind of easy to make software i could make to earn money, do you have any ideas?

i tried to built an animation software once but the project is not compatible with anything anymore and it was really time consuming, i'm asking myself if i should rebuild it from scratch or build another easier project.
