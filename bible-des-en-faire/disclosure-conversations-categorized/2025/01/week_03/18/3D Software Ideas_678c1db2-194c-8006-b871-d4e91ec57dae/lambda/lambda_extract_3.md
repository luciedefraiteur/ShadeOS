Decide Whether to Rebuild Your Animation Software
Rebuilding your animation software could work if:
- It had unique features or solved specific problems that aren’t already well-addressed in the market.
- You can scope it down to an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and focus on a niche audience (e.g., indie animators, educators, or hobbyists).
- You use modern frameworks to avoid compatibility issues in the future.
