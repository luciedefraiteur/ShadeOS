It depends on how it's affecting your life. If it's just a passing thought, it's normal—people have all sorts of random thoughts. But if it's intrusive and distracting, it might help to:

1. **Understand the Cause** – Are you curious, anxious, or obsessed? Sometimes, repetitive thoughts are linked to curiosity, stress, or even boredom.  
2. **Engage in Activities** – Keeping busy with hobbies, exercise, or socializing can help redirect your focus.  
3. **Practice Mindfulness** – Meditation or grounding techniques can help manage intrusive thoughts.  
4. **Seek Professional Help** – If it's interfering with daily life, a therapist can help explore the root cause and ways to manage it.  

Does it feel like it's more of a habit, curiosity, or something else?
