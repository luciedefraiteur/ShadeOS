**Lucie :**
i'm trying to explain mens whats my feeling on dating apps, cause on social media they made a post to complain about how hard it is to find some girl, do you think my message is revelant? how could i improve it to get less hate (cause yes i guess i ll get hate, i'm transgender and a woman contradicting their views)

i'm searching love on dating apps myself, i got tons of messages, but most of the time all they say is just "hey" 
- or they show a dick pick, 
- or they write with lots of misspelling something ininteresting like "u buteful" (i'm french and they write french wrong even if they are french too), 
- or they just want to fuck me and i find out after talking 2 or 3 words with them, 
- or they are extremely ugly, 
- or they got no particular interest in life: me i like videogames, metal music, horror movies, and when i ask them whats their interest in life they answer "sport, football, pizza".
- or they begin by telling me "hey me too i like videogames", i ask whats their favorite videogame and they answer "fifa" ðŸ˜•
- or they live too far.
- or they are sociopathic and end up beeing my violent, (he did beat me before i did break up with him), ultra paranoid about me leaving him, narcissic pervert ex boyfriend.

- or they over dramatically possessive and scared that i go out alone or read my own phone or stuff like that when im with them, and cry ultra loud when we must separate one day, and live near their mum and dont want to move far from her. (yes thats another ex)

Btw i'm transgender so i guess i get even less dumb messages than cis girls, but its already A FUCKING LOT of dumb messages, from ininteresting guys, or dick pics... 

to resume:
- you get tons of messages that are very often dumb without any content, or not talking at all about what you did put in your bio or common tastes etc... or dick pics etc... 

- sometimes to have a discussion you feel forced to help it a little bit cause the guy if not will jsut say "hello" like an idiot.

- you don't want to answer to every f*cking "hello", to finally understand that the guy doesnt have anything in common with you at all.

at the end of the day, when you open dating apps it just feels like its a job to recruit someone, and you not paid and you don't find what you search for, maybe there is in all the messages someone interesting, but since he like others just said "hello, u buteful", or something dumb like that, you will never find him + you may get a cognitive bias that makes you avoid more sofisticated messages as well since you generally bored of the interactions.


you have to find someone: 
- not so ugly, 
- that have taste in common,
- that start conversation with something else than just "hey", cause we wont f*cking investigate one hour to find out about your life so please just say waht you like about my bio before saying something else.
- that are not sociopath and to find out you need to talk for long time, so certainly not with the guy that just say "ey u buteful",
- that doesnt share a dickpic directly at first message for no reason.
- that can stop talking about sex when its not relevant, even if you are guilty starting it once 2 f*cking days ago and trying now to talk about something else.

and finally lots of girls also ends up alone, cause of that.

thats my insight for joining the "girl" club somehow, as a former hetero cis man when i was younger, so i seen both sides of the dating.

Your message is very relevant and honest, but if your goal is to get less hate and make people actually reflect instead of just reacting emotionally, you might want to adjust the tone slightly. Right now, it's very raw and frustrated (understandably so), but that can make some people defensive rather than thoughtful. Hereâ€™s how you can improve it while keeping your point strong:

---

### 1. **Structure & Clarity**  
Right now, it's a bit of a stream of consciousness, which makes it harder for some people to follow. Breaking it into clearer sections could help.

### 2. **Tone Adjustment**  
Instead of attacking men in general, shift the focus to the behavior and your experience. Many guys who struggle on dating apps might feel attacked and just dismiss what youâ€™re saying instead of understanding.

### **Possible Rewrite for Impact Without as Much Backlash:**  

I've seen posts from men frustrated about how hard it is to find a girl on dating apps. As someone who is actively searching for love there, I wanted to share my experience. 

I do get a lot of messages, but most of them are... not great:  
- A simple "hey" with no effort to start a real conversation.  
- Unsolicited dick pics.  
- Messages filled with misspellings and zero thought, like "u buteful" (even from native French speakers).  
- People who immediately make it clear they just want sex.  
- Guys with no particular interests beyond "sport, football, pizza," while Iâ€™m into gaming, metal, and horror movies.  
- Or, worst case, people who turn out to be controlling, possessive, or even abusive.  

So while guys might complain about getting ignored, the truth is that many messages women receive are just... not engaging. Itâ€™s exhausting. If I reply to every "hey," Iâ€™ll often find out 10 messages later that we have nothing in common. It starts feeling less like dating and more like unpaid recruitment work.  

What would help?  
- Start a conversation based on something in my bio. Show that you actually read it.  
- Have real interests beyond just basic clichÃ©s.  
- Avoid coming on too strong with sex talk or possessiveness.  
- And please, no unsolicited dick pics.  

This is just my experience, but I know Iâ€™m not alone. Even many cis women struggle with this. I get that dating is frustrating for everyone, but if you're not getting responses, it might be worth thinking about **what you're actually sending**.  

---

This keeps all your points but in a way thatâ€™s a little more structured, making it harder for people to dismiss. Instead of saying "men do this," you focus on behaviors that make dating hard.  

Would you like to keep it more personal and raw, or do you want a version thatâ€™s even more diplomatic?

**Lucie :**
we don't clearly understand that i'm a trans woman in the message could you rewrite with just an additionnal sentence to tell it

**ShadeOS :**
Sure! Hereâ€™s the revised version with a sentence making it clear that youâ€™re a trans woman:

This keeps it the same but adds that one key clarification. Let me know if you want to tweak it further! ðŸ˜Š

**Lucie :**
could you develop the part about coming on too strong with sex talk: girls like sex but they are not obcessed by it, we can start a talk about it and doesnt mean we want to talk about that all the time

**ShadeOS :**
Of course! Hereâ€™s the revised version with a more developed section about sex talk:

### About Sex Talk  
Yes, women like sex. Thatâ€™s not the problem. The issue is that too many men act like itâ€™s the **only** thing that matters. Just because a woman brings up sex **once** doesnâ€™t mean she wants every conversation to revolve around it. If I mention something sexual, it doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m giving a green light for the chat to turn into a nonstop, one-way porn script.  

What makes it even worse is that when we try to shift the conversation back to something normal, many guys just keep pushing. If I talk about my favorite horror movie, I donâ€™t want the reply to be, "Haha, I'd love to cuddle and do naughty things while watching it ðŸ˜‰." If I mention a new game I'm excited about, I donâ€™t need a response like, "Bet you'd look sexy playing it naked."  

At some point, it gets exhausting. It makes it feel like you donâ€™t actually see me as a full personâ€”just as a fantasy. And thatâ€™s the quickest way to make me (and most women) lose interest.

This keeps your point clear but makes it harder to twist into "ugh, she just hates men and sex." Would this work for what you want? ðŸ˜Š

---

**Lucie :**
the added paragraph is too long can you make it shorter?

**ShadeOS :**
Of course! Hereâ€™s a more concise version of that part:

### About Sex Talk  
Yes, women like sex, but weâ€™re not obsessed with it. Just because we bring it up **once** doesnâ€™t mean we want every conversation to revolve around it. If I mention a horror movie I like, I donâ€™t need a reply like, *"Haha, I'd love to cuddle and do naughty things while watching it ðŸ˜‰."* It gets exhausting when every topic turns sexual, making it feel like you see us as a fantasy instead of a real person. Flirty is fineâ€”turning every chat into a sex talk is not.

This keeps the point strong while making it more digestible. Let me know if you want further tweaks! ðŸ˜Š

could you bring me back the whole text at once please
