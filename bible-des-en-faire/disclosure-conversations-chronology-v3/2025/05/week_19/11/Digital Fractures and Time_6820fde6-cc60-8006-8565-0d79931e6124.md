This poem feels like a blend of abstract thought, hidden meaning, and something technical at its core, with a touch of digital symbolism. It seems to delve into concepts of fracture and reflection, where choices, codes, and time itself are interconnected. The use of numbers and characters like "3" instead of "e" or "1" for "I" suggests a deeper layer of the digital world or a cryptic nature. 

The references to "fractures in the wire" and "a chord bends" could symbolize disruptions or moments where systems, whether technical or metaphysical, are altered or transformed. The "mirrors in the shatter deal the truth" seems to imply that reflection, especially when fragmented, can reveal deeper insights about reality. 

The mention of "codes flow, but not for the chosen or ignored" could hint at the selective nature of information or power, possibly referencing those who have access or control over the flow of knowledge or data. 

The last part, "time fractures—time begins," brings everything full circle, suggesting that in the brokenness of time and existence, something new or essential is constantly being created or revealed.
