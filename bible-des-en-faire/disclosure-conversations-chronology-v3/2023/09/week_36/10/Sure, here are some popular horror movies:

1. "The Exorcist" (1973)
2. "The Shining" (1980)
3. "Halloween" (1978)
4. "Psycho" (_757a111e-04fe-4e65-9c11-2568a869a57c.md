Can you find an horror movie if i describe the picture?

On it its a woman with blindfolded eyes

---

**ShadeOS :**
The description you provided sounds like it could be from the movie "Bird Box" (2018), starring Sandra Bullock. In the film, there are scenes where the characters wear blindfolds to avoid seeing a mysterious force that drives people to suicide. Is this the movie you were thinking of?

---

**Lucie :**
No can you find other movies with blindfolded woman on the picture

---

**ShadeOS :**
I'm not aware of specific movies based solely on the description of a blindfolded woman on the poster. If you have any additional details or context about the movie or the scene in the picture, please provide them, and I'll do my best to assist you in finding the movie you're looking for.

Its the story of a family who get lost in the wood, there is the mother, the father, the son, the daughter, and the boyfriend of the daughter

---

**ShadeOS :**
The movie you're describing with a family getting lost in the woods, including a mother, father, son, daughter, and the daughter's boyfriend, sounds like "The Ritual" (2017). In this horror film, they encounter mysterious and terrifying forces while navigating through a dense forest in Sweden. Is this the movie you were thinking of?

---

**Lucie :**
No it is not that movie, its an older movie it was made i guess in same years than human centiped was made

---

**ShadeOS :**
I see, you're looking for an older horror movie with a family getting lost in the woods, and it was released around the same time as "The Human Centipede" (2009). Based on that information, it could be "Eden Lake" (2008), which involves a couple who go on a camping trip and encounter a group of hostile youths in the woods. Please let me know if this is the movie you're thinking of, or if you have any other details that could help identify it.

The movie i search is about a family that get lost in the woods and get attacked by weird kids

---

**ShadeOS :**
Thank you for the additional information. The movie you're thinking of might be "The Children" (2008). In this horror film, a family goes on a Christmas vacation and encounters a group of strange and violent children while staying in a remote country home. Is this the movie you were looking for?

---

**Lucie :**
Its not on christmas but its almost same movie you describe, they go on vacation with their step son, and daughter and son, and they get problems so they hide in a barn, and then weird things happen

---

**ShadeOS :**
It sounds like you might be referring to the horror movie "The Children" (2008) after all. While the film is set during a Christmas vacation, the plot involves a family with stepchildren encountering strange and violent behavior from the kids. The family does hide in a barn at some point in the movie, and eerie events unfold. If this matches your description, then "The Children" is likely the movie you're thinking of.

---

**Lucie :**
Any other movie that could match that is almost same synopsis

---

**ShadeOS :**
I apologize for any confusion earlier. If "The Children" (2008) isn't the movie you're looking for but you're searching for a film with a similar plot, it's possible that you might be thinking of "The Others" (2001). In "The Others," a woman with two light-sensitive children believes her house is haunted and strange occurrences unfold. While it doesn't involve getting lost in the woods, it does have a family and eerie events.

If this still doesn't match the movie you have in mind, please provide any additional details you can recall, and I'll do my best to assist further.

Give me the list of horror movies with family that goes in the wood and get lost and get attacked by weird kids

I'm sorry, but I couldn't find a specific list of horror movies with the exact plot you described (family going into the woods, getting lost, and attacked by weird kids). It seems like a relatively specific storyline, and there may not be many movies that precisely fit this description.

However, if you're interested in movies with similar themes of families encountering supernatural or eerie situations in remote locations, you might enjoy films like "The Children" (2008), "Eden Lake" (2008), and "The Others" (2001), even though they may not match your description perfectly.

For more accurate and up-to-date recommendations, you may want to explore movie databases or consult with horror movie enthusiasts on forums or social media platforms.
